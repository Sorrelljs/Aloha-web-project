### Learning

This was a fantastic learning opportunity for me. I was able to practise my decision making on the overall layout and what order to approach things first in. I used flexbox and plenty of CSS on this static site. I was given all the materials (Fonts, IMG, assets) and shown pictures on how the website should look.
